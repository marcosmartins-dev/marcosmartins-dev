<strong>Hey.. it’s me, Marcos!</strong>

Despite the fact that I originally came from the business field, I’ve been flirting with development and design for a while. But, in May 2022 I finally decided to change the game for me. And since then I start to pursue my better version, always looking to be better than yesterday.

I’m a technology and design enthusiast, willing to learn more and more, looking for some day really impact in people’s lives.

• Solid knowledge in business area;
• Proficient on Figma prototyping tool;
• Proficient on Adobe’s package (Illustrator, Photoshop, Lightroom, After Effects and Premiere);
• In progress with languages: HTML, CSS and Javascript;
• Next steps: Typescript, NodeJS, React and Vue.
